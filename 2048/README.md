### 2048 
(that popular mobile game back around ~2014)\

This program uses the library conio.h, which doesn't seem to be available on MacOS

Basic coding concepts used:
  - nothing special really

What's included:
  - point counting system

How to play:
  - press WASD to shift tiles up, left, down, or right respectively
  - to lose: run out of space
  - to win: reach a tile of 2048 (though the game continues)

Notable issues:
  - if a tile's number is becomes larger than 4 digits, the display of the grid will print improperly
