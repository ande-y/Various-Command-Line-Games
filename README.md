# Random Games in Terminal

### ABOUT THIS  
This repository is a collection of the programs with replicate basic tabletop games or simple mobile games you may have played.  

Each game will be contained in a singular C++ script. They're implemented in as rudimentary of a fashion as possible. There is no use of any GUI system, so all graphics are printed directly in the terminal & interfacing with the game utilizes the keyboard only. 

### COMPATIBILITY
All programs are written from the perspective of a windows user. For Mac device users, there may be code within a program that can prevent the game from running properly. Preferebly, compile the code with GCC rather than Clang.

### PURPOSE
All programs in this repository solely written by me for the purpose of coding practice. Feel free to download & play. Playing the games simply requires compiling & running the executable in a terminal. 

Enjoy :)
